# Final_Project_3 - Dog Breed App
In this project, we aimed to predict the characteristics of five German dog breeds using data on their average height, weight, and lifespan. We started by extracting relevant information from a CSV file containing data on various dog breeds. Focusing on the German breeds, we narrowed down the dataset and utilized the Random Forest Classifier from SKLearn to model and predict the data. To present our findings, we developed a Streamlit app, enhancing its visual appeal with a colored header and a soothing blue background. We also provided customization options for users, allowing them to upload their CSV files for personalized predictions. Additionally, we explored the use of Pickle files for storing and loading data but encountered some challenges. Although Pickle offers flexibility in serializing Python objects, it also poses security risks and may not be as efficient as other formats like JSON.
